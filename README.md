## Hi there 👋

I have worked in several areas over the years - in development, database administration and security. I have been fortunate to have had the chance to design and implement some interesting systems in the financial and engineering spaces. I have also had the chance to work as a lead DBA on some exciting go-live and "early days" production databases. For the last 12 years my focus has been on security, first as escalated customer support for configuraton and product problems and then as a lead QA tester working with Oracle Base Development in India and the US.  This involved code review, vulnerability and functional testing and tool design to find security issues in the code. I am passionate about code and security so this was a great time. I am now freelance again and researching security issues in production code alongside helping companies with their security reviews. 

Outside of work I enjoy walking, wild swimming and dogs - particularly my pug who is a law unto herself but very cute.
